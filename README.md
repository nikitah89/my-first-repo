# my-frist-repo
This is my first github repo, I have just started learning a thing or two about Github. Creating a repo and performing various actions such as creating a branch, push, pull request, merge and rebase will help me gain a better understanding of how things work around in here.

This is the text i am adding as a part of my first commit on the new branch "branch-one"
